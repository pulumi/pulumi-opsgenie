/**
 * Manages a Team within Opsgenie.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```typescript
 * import * as pulumi from "@pulumi/pulumi";
 * import * as opsgenie from "@pulumi/opsgenie";
 *
 * const first = new opsgenie.User("first", {
 *     username: "user@domain.com",
 *     fullName: "name ",
 *     role: "User",
 * });
 * const second = new opsgenie.User("second", {
 *     username: "test@domain.com",
 *     fullName: "name ",
 *     role: "User",
 * });
 * const test = new opsgenie.Team("test", {
 *     name: "example",
 *     description: "This team deals with all the things",
 *     members: [
 *         {
 *             id: first.id,
 *             role: "admin",
 *         },
 *         {
 *             id: second.id,
 *             role: "user",
 *         },
 *     ],
 * });
 * const self_service = new opsgenie.Team("self-service", {
 *     name: "Self Service",
 *     description: "Membership in this team is managed via OpsGenie web UI only",
 *     ignoreMembers: true,
 *     deleteDefaultResources: true,
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * ## Import
 *
 * Teams can be imported using the `team_id`, e.g.
 *
 * ```sh
 * $ pulumi import opsgenie:index/team:Team team1 team_id`
 * ```
